# Consumer-Churn-Prediction
The term 'Churn' means to leave a company. It is very important for companies to determine the reasons why people are churning out of the company. 

This Project intends to do the same. I have used the WA Telecom Services dataset for this project. The datasets consisted of 20 features (independent variables) and 1 target variable.
The features consited of variables like gender, senior citizen, internet service, tenure, monthly charges, total charges, etc.

In this project, I have majorly done the following things:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Building and evaluation

The observations are mentioned in the notebook itself.

I used 4 classifiers: Ridge Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier and Support Vector Machine. Out of the 4 classifiers, Random Forest classifier and support vector machine
gave the highest prediction accuracy of 94%. Thus, these 2 classifiers proved to be the best for our binary classification task.
